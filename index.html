      <h2>TEAM PROFILE</h2>
      <h4>Team name: EVOL</h4>
      <h4>My test results:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Myers-Briggs Test: ISTP-T</li>
        <li>Learning Style Test: Auditory 40%, Visual 30%, Tactile 30%</li>
        <li>Big Five Personalities Test: Openness 85%, Conscientiousness 29%, Extraversion 35%, Agreeableness 65%, Neuroticism 48%</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Team profile:</h4>
      <p class="info">According to my test results, I could be considered as a little bit shy and introverted. Therefore, I would like to work with a team that consist of many proactive and talkative members that would help me to communicate well with the whole group. When I get to know the group and comfortable expressing myself, I will be able to contribute my best to the whole team. I also do not think that I am capable of being the group leader, so I would need a leader that is determined and can guide us throughout the project. Because I am an auditory learner, online meetings for sharing ideas and discussing verbally would help me work better than messaging or chatting.</p>

      <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
      <p class="info">My project is to create an app that simulates the process of a
        surgery and allows user to perform a virtual surgery on it. The app could be run on a VR
        environment or just simply on a computer or a smart device. If in Virtual Reality, users
        will have to be equipped with VR headsets and our VR surgery kit. The application would be
        able to simulate real human bodies with different illnesses or damaged areas that needs surgery.</p>
      <p class="info">Although this idea is not original since there are many companies that already
        applied Virtual Reality to train their surgeons, it is not popular in Vietnam to use this
        technology in the medical industry. Therefore, I would like to develop a pure Vietnamese app
        for Vietnamese people, medical students, and doctors to learn and practice. My goal is to
        provide a convenient and efficient method as an alternative way to learn about surgery that
        does not requires a real human body.</p>
      <p class="info">As mentioned before, the application would be available on both PC and mobile
        platforms and provides a VR option. A VR surgery kit would also be developed to support the
        virtual experiences of users. The kit would contain interactive replicas of surgery knives,
        scissors, etc. which are fundamental tools when performing an operation. The first key feature
        of the app would be the ability to simulate human bodies of different age, gender, height and
        weight as your patient. Of course, the generated body would not be precise since different people
        has different body proportions, we will do research and get the average proportions of each
        group of age and gender. Therefore, creating bodies that are closest to the real ones. The
        second key feature is the ability to recreate blood, flesh and organs of the patient in the
        most realistic way using 3D modeling. This would require deep research of how the human body
        works and investments on the 3D developing field. The third key feature is the ability to mimic
        real illnesses and simulate damaged parts/organs of the patient. This feature is the core
        feature since user will mainly be interacting and operating surgeries on the damaged parts
        of the body. When it comes to using the application, the user will be asked for inputting
        parameters of the patient (gender, age, weight, height) and select the kind of sickness
        that they are dealing with (mainly the ones that requires a surgery). After that, the system
        will generate a virtual surgery room with the patient and let user to start the operation.
        Time limitation will be provided base on each kind of illness as well as heart rate/breath
        rate machine to monitor the current state of the patient. The operation will success if the
        user does the right procedures in the right amount of time and fails if they exceed the time
        limit or make critical mistakes. There will be two modes of the app, one is learning mode
        which gives user instructions on how to perform the surgery. The other mode would be practice
        mode that provides no instructions but a grading system on how well the operation has been done.
        Levels from normal (easy) to extremely serious (hard) cases would be provided for user to
        select base on their medical experience. We will also be supporting users with videos and
        documentations about many kinds of illness for a better learning experience. Since there
        are operations that needs two or more surgeons, our app will provide a collab session for
        user to connect and work together in one surgery via Wi-Fi or an online server. For the
        purpose of education, after a user accomplishes a certain milestone (a combination of many
        surgeries), they will receive our certificate that could be worthy in the future. </p>
      <p class="info">For the developing process, I think Unity would be the best option to build
        the application since it is one of the most reliable game/simulation developing software
        that supports both PC and mobile platforms. VR is also supported on Unity which makes the
        most important part of the application. VR consoles in form of surgery kits such as knifes,
        scissors, pliers, etc. should also be researched and produced to assist the user and make
        it become more realistic. Furthermore, deep research about human organs, illnesses and how
        to perform surgeries on different kind of problems that patients have would be the core
        feature that we focus on.</p>
      <p class="info">The skills required for this project would be programming, teamworking and
        researching. Because Unity is used to develop the app, we would practice the programming
        language C# since it is the main language that is used in the software. For this is an
        extremely challenging project that requires a lot of effort and research, we will need
        to work as a team of many members, each person will have different tasks. Therefore,
        teamworking skills are crucial for the group to work smoothly.</p>
      <p class="info">If this project become successful, it will create opportunities for medical
        students to practice surgery on unreal bodies, which is a lot more convenient and cost less
        than performing on an actual corpse. This way will help students to learn faster since they
        can do multiple surgeries in one day. Surgeons could also use our app to practice before a
        real operation so that it could be done precisely and increase the successful rate. Finally,
        our goal is to improve the medical industry of Vietnam, doctors will be more skillful so
        that more lives would be saved.</p>

      <h2>IT TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
      <h4>Virtual/Augmented Reality</h4>
      <p class="info">These are by far the two most advanced technologies that human can use to
        interact with computers. With the VR technology, it allows us to enter a whole different
        world that is created inside the of computer (with the support with VR gears such as VR
        glasses, headsets, etc.). User will enter a virtual environment that is made to look as
        vivid and lively as the real world. This virtual environment is generated by the computer
        itself using 3D rendering. In most cases, the user will need to have a VR headset connected
        to a computer or a smart device to use this technology. Nowadays, this tech is most commonly
        used to develop games and simulations. To be inside of a game and play it just like the real
        word is every gamers’ dream. It brings a lot of excitement and whole new experiences to gamers
        while traveling inside the gaming world. Some of the most popular VR games are Beat Saber,
        Half-Life: Alyx, SUPERHOT. I have tried playing VR Beat Saber before and can tell that it
        is a very well-developed game and very fun to play. Furthermore, this technology can involve
        in a lot of other industries such as aviation where they use VR flight simulators to train
        pilots, or even in the education industry where students can explore new knowledges and see
        the outside world within their classroom.</p>
      <p class="info">The AR technology on the other hand is slightly different from VR since it does not provide an entirely virtual experience but rather generates what is called a mixed reality. This kind of reality is created by using a computer to view the real world. Applying cognitive science and 3D rendering, the computer will be able to scan the outside world using a camera and add more details to it base on the purpose of the application. For instance, Pokemon Go is once a very popular game that uses AR in its operating system. User can view their current position on its map and see nearby pokemons. When comes to capturing a pokemon, user will have to open their camera and that pokemon will appear inside the camera just like how it is in the real world. This kind of tech could be effectively used in a lot of different industries to display more information. For example, lots of fashion brands have offered AR for user to try-on their products with the precision of 70-80% like they are trying clothes at the real store. Maybe in the future, human will be able to create a whole different reality that looks and feels just like real life.</p>
      <p class="info">Although it is still not very common in Vietnam to see these two technologies applying in real life circumstances other than gaming due to its very high price and can cause inconvenience to user (big headsets, dizziness after using for a long period of time). I believe that AR/VR will continuously be developed for better user experience and will become an extremely dominant technology in the future. It would bring a huge impact to the entertainment industry when customers do not have to actually go to a certain place such as cinemas, museums to watch movies or see art, but enjoying all those services remotely at home. In a near future, labor in all industry would be equipped with a pair of smart glasses that scans their surroundings and display work-related information.</p>
      <p class="info">Until now, these technologies have not brought any significant impact to my daily life, other than offering more gaming options. </p>
      <h4>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h4>
      <p class="info">Artificial Intelligence is the term for the process of mimicking human behavior of computers. Ever since the creation of human, we have always been improving our labor tools from time to time, decades through decades. Until these days, technology has shifted the way we work, and scientists are searching for a way that machines could do all the work for humans, brings the definition of Artificial Intelligence. Computers can be taught to think like human by many methods, one of them is Machine Learning. Loads of data will be provided to computers to generate patterns or useful information using algorithms developed by humans. For instance, when using the world’s largest music streaming platform – Spotify, the application will monitor user’s behavior like what music genre they listen to the most, and then generates songs recommendations that fits the user’s interest. The process requires an amount of input information and through an algorithm, beneficial information will be extracted. The more powerful and well-developed the algorithm is, the more reliable and valuable the output statistics would be. Applying AI to robots, we can create machines that have “brains” and can interact with human. Sophia, a robot developed by Hanson Robotics is considered the smartest robot in the world since she can communicate and display facial expressions just like a normal person. Furthermore, automation in many aspects of our daily life is being developed using AI. Tesla have created the auto-pilot mode for their electronic cars that is said to assist drivers when driving. The car will be able to scan its surroundings for vehicles, road signs and other obstacles, and automatically. The car also can detect for danger, if seeing potentials of an accident it would emergency brake or drift to another direction. Although the driver must put their hands on the wheels throughout the drive since we cannot rely entirely on machines, it still brings lots of convenience to the driver and enhances road safety. Creation of virtual assistants such as Alexa or Siri is also the application of AI. These non-human assistants can communicate well with us and can perform simple tasks like scheduling or search something on your phones. In the future, robots would inherit human’s intelligence and grow even smarter than our kind. Machines then would replace human to work since they cannot feel tired and leads to the burst of work efficiency in every industry. Of course, to get machine to think just like us, they will need a lot of technology enhancements to help deep learning, have cognitive behavior and the ability to process information continuously for better decision making.</p>
      <p class="info">The greatest impact of Artificial Intelligence is making human’s life easier. More and more of the stuff we use in our daily life are being automated such as vacuum robots, fridge, washing machines. Many industries have already used robots to do some simple to complex works that are assisted and monitored by human. By using technology, we do not have to put so much effort in working like how it is before. Automation helps us perform work faster and workers do not have to know how to make the product but rather learn how to use machines. Dangerous tasks could now be done by machines which keeps the workforce safe and less tired. This leads to the rise in productivity but could also cause some downsides. Since machines can do all the work, it would leave people unemployed, poverty rate would then rise. Studies have shown that more and more job are being replaced by automation. For example, front desk works such as customer consulting or support could be easily done by a well-developed virtual assistant or chatbot. Human could also be relying so much on machines that they may lose many crucial life skills. Some health problems such as obesity would appear if people do not physically work or exercise enough.</p>
      <p class="info">In my daily life, AI helps me do house chores such as cleaning house using vacuum robot, washing clothes using an automated machine that requires only putting clothes in and push the start button. It indeed has helped me saved a lot of time and effort and I could use my time to do other stuff such as studying or entertainment.  With entertaining purposes, algorithms in platforms like YouTube, TikTok or Spotify have always giving out relevant video and music recommendations so that I do not have to find myself crawling through the website/application to look for the content that fits my interests. </p>

      <h1>IT WORK</h1>

      <h4>Mark Zuckerberg - CEO and Co-founder of Facebook</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DdDE4i5eJE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="info">1. Mark is known for being the founder and CEO of Facebook – the largest social network on the planet, and the owner of other networks such as Instagram or WhatsApp. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are the fields that he is also currently working on.</p>
      <p class="info">2. As the CEO of Facebook, Mark can be interacting with people from all around the world. When inside the corporation, he would meet directors, managers from different fields like the Cyber Security department or the Design department. He could also meet any famous people like actors, singers and even politics like the President. When conferences are being held, Mark Zuckerberg will speak to the general public including his clients, customers, interviewers, etc.</p>
      <p class="info">3. It’s hard to determine where Mark Zuckerberg spends most of his time as since he is traveling around a lot for work. I think he would spend a big amount of time at Facebook where he will control the company and do research on other technological sides such as AR/VR of Oculus.</p>
      <p class="info">4. The most challenging thing about Mark Zuckerberg’s position is the ability to manage time efficiently and the ability to multitask. Being the owner of Facebook and many other subsidiaries, the amount of work that he has to deal with in one day is massive. Therefore, Mark has to divide his time for not only a balance and healthy routine, but also keep up with his working progress.</p>

      <h4>Justin Hammond – A Software Engineer</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1fc0FlCjyI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="info">1. Justin Hammond’s work is mainly coding, designing and administrating applications. He often has to deal with feedbacks from his GitHub, and as well as giving feedbacks to his other co-workers.</p>
      <p class="info">2. In the video, Justin firstly interacts with his user’s comments on GitHub to find improvements on the software. Then he would check for emails from vendors and write feedbacks for his co-worker’s code. Justin also had an online meeting with his team which is a group of IT professionals.</p>
      <p class="info">3. Maybe due to COVID-19, Justin spends most of his time working in his room at home or it could be his regular workspace.</p>
      <p class="info">4. I think the hardest part about Justin Hammond’s job is the ability to work as a team. In the video, he had to give his peers recommendations on their codes and take other’s feedback on his program. He also had meetings and work in pair with one of the members of his team.</p>

      <h4>Stefanovic – A Data Analyst</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0vLQvJ3piE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="info">1. Stefanovic work is creating and maintaining stakeholder dashboards as well as debugging and testing out new functionalities of them. He also works as a content creator on YouTube and do video editing. </p>
      <p class="info">2. In Stefanovic’s day he firstly interacts with stakeholders which are his customers for product requirements and feedback. He also had meetings with his colleagues to discuss and debug their dashboards.</p>
      <p class="info">3. Stefanovic spends most of his time working remotely at home on his personal computer.</p>
      <p class="info">4. I think the most challenging about Stefanovic’s position is that he has to work and listen to his customers to create a product that is suitable for them. Teamwork is also involved since he have to work in groups to finish developing a multifunctional dashboard.</p>

      <h4>Tal Kelley – A Cyber Security Professional</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CdQV4Ci3v0M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="info">1. Tal’s job is to work with company’s cyber security system and servers. In the video, he said he was setting up a scanner to scan vulnerabilities on the company’s devices connecting to their network.</p>
      <p class="info">2. The video did not show any people that Tal interacted with throughout his day other than some emails and some Reddit posts. But base on his job, I think that he will be interacting mainly with some of his colleagues and his boss for work requirements.</p>
      <p class="info">3. Tal Kelley spends most of his time inside of his office working on a laptop and a computer with two screens.</p>
      <p class="info">4. The hardest part in this job is the ability to analyze the weaknesses in the system’s security and applying layers of protection to it. Cyber Security Professionals also have to defend their data and servers when being attacked by hackers or DDOS. </p>

      <h4>Marilag Dimatulac – A Cloud Architect</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRx6pFRwVDA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class="info">1. Marilag’s job is to create and maintain cloud services such as the “Self Service Portal for Developers” that she mentioned in the video.</p>
      <p class="info">2. In her daily life, Marilag would be interacting with her team which is a group of cloud architects. She will also communicate with managers from different departments such as the Community Program manager or the Office manager that is interviewed in the video.</p>
      <p class="info">3. In the video, Marilag mentioned that she has been working from home for four months. Therefore, she would spend most of her time in her personal working space at home.</p>
      <p class="info">4. Marilag said that one challenging aspect in her job is to divide a big problem into smaller software components and deal with them separately. Each component also has to have less dependency to not build a big system, and so that every component can communicate well to each other. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <h4>Feedback 1:</h4>
      <p class="info" style="font-style:Italic;">“This is a very cool idea that combines playing and studying and helps user to explore freely while learning on the application. VR is also very applicable since it brings the most realistic experience to users. However, I think that developing this kind of application can consume a lot of time and work. The developer must have strong medical backgrounds so that the knowledge transmission would not be faulty and leads to misunderstandings.”</p>
      <h4>Feedback 2:</h4>
      <p class="info" style="font-style:Italic;">“I think your project is very practical and brings multiple educational values. Future and current surgeon could learn a lot about surgery processes while don’t have to perform on real human corpses, which I think is a very compact and efficient way to study. The technology used in this app – VR is also an innovative way to present and operate the simulation. Overall, I think this idea is great and would have a lot of use in the future.”</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p class="info">The feedbacks that I received from my two teammates were both very positive. The root of my idea is to use technology to help people learn and practice more efficiently. Because it is an app installed on your personal device, you can use it anywhere anytime so it would be a lot more convenient for student to study. The reason I chose VR for the app is because it brings the realest experience and when performing surgery is dealing with human life, it should be as precise as it is in real life. I agree that developing this application will cost a huge amount of time and effort, but it is still just a raw idea inside my head. I will have to learn a lot more about programming and more in order to initiate the project. Teamwork is compulsory and I would find people that have the same goal and thinking as I for the project to work smoothly. About the knowledge in medical, I would find a doctor/surgeon to associate with the project as our advisor, so that we would not give out any misleading information and knowledge to our user. And because of that, strong medical backgrounds would not be necessary for our developers.</p>
